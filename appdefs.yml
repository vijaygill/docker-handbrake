    sections:
      - title: Access to Optical Drives
        level: 2
        content: |-
          By default, a Docker container does not have access to host's devices. However,
          access to one or more devices can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter
          of the `docker run` command.

          In Linux, optical drives are represented by device files named `/dev/srX`, where
          `X` is a number (e.g., `/dev/sr0` for the first drive, `/dev/sr1` for the
          second, etc). To allow {{ app.friendly_name }} to access the first drive, use
          this parameter:

          ```
          --device /dev/sr0
          ```

          To identify the correct Linux devices to expose, check the container's log
          during startup. Look for messages like:
          ```
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive 'hp HLDS DVDRW GUD1N LD02' [/dev/sr0]
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ OK ]   associated SCSI CD-ROM (sr) device detected: /dev/sr0.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ ERR ]  the host device /dev/sr0 is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drives found.
          ```

          This indicates that `/dev/sr0` needs to be exposed to the container.

          > [!TIP]
          > View the container’s log by running `docker logs <container_name>`.

          Alternatively, identify Linux devices from the host by running:

          ```
          lsscsi -k
          ```

          The output's last column for an optical drive indicates the device to expose.
          The following example shows that `/dev/sr0` should be exposed:

          ```
          [0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      SanDisk SSD PLUS 9100  /dev/sda
          [1:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      SanDisk SSD PLUS 9100  /dev/sdb
          [2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      ST3500418AS      HP34  /dev/sdc
          [4:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  hp HLDS  DVDRW  GUD1N     LD02  /dev/sr0
          ```

          Since {{ app.friendly_name }} can decrypt DVD video discs, conversions can be
          performed directly from the optical device. In the GUI, click the `Open Source`
          button and browse to the optical drive device in the file system
          (e.g., `/dev/sr0`).
      - title: Automatic Video Conversion
        level: 2
        content: |-
          This container includes a built-in automatic video converter for
          batch-converting videos without user interaction.

          Files placed in the `/watch` container folder are automatically converted by
          {{ app.friendly_name }} to a predefined video format using a specified preset.

          All configuration parameters for the automatic video converter are set via
          environment variables. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
          section for available variables, particularly those starting with
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_`.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Presets are identified by their category and name (e.g.,
          > `General/Very Fast 1080p30`).

          > [!NOTE]
          > All default and custom presets can be viewed and edited in the
          > {{ app.friendly_name }} GUI.

          > [!NOTE]
          > By default, converted videos are stored in the `/output` folder of the
          > container.

          > [!NOTE]
          > The status and progress of conversions can be monitored via the GUI or the
          > container’s log. View the log with `docker logs <container name>`, Full
          > conversion details are stored in `/config/log/hb/conversion.log` within the
          > container.
      - title: Multiple Watch Folders
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Additional watch folders can be used, such as:
            - `/watch2`
            - `/watch3`
            - `/watch4`
            - `/watch5`
            - etc.

          This is useful for scenarios where videos require different presets (e.g., one
          folder for movies and another for TV shows with distinct encoding quality
          requirements).

          By default, additional watch folders inherit the settings of the main `/watch`
          folder. To override a setting for a specific watch folder, append its index to
          the environment variable name. For example, to set the preset for `/watch2`, use
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET_2`. For `/watch3`, use
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET_3`, and so on.

          All settings prefixed with `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_` can be overridden for each
          additional watch folder.

          The maximum number of watch folders is defined by the
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_MAX_WATCH_FOLDERS` environment variable.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Each additional watch folder must be mapped to a host folder via a volume
          > mapping during container creation.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Each output folder defined via `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_DIR` must be
          > mapped to a host folder via a volume mapping during container creation.
      - title: Multiple Containers Capability
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Multiple container instances can operate on the same watch folder to increase
          throughput and parallelize video conversions. Each container monitors the folder
          independently and picks up available video files for processing.

          > [!NOTE]
          > The watch folder must be writable by all containers, since each container
          > creates a lock file in the folder before starting a conversion. This ensures
          > that no two containers process the same video at the same time.

          > [!NOTE]
          > To prevent already-converted videos from being picked up again, configure each
          > container to remove the source file once processing is finished. This can be
          > enforced by setting the `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_KEEP_SOURCE` environment
          > variable to `0`.
      - title: Video Discs
        level: 3
        content: |-
          The automatic video converter supports video discs in the following format:
            - ISO image file
            - DVD video disc folder containing the `VIDEO_TS` folder
            - Blu-ray video disc folder containing the `BDMV` folder

          Folder names are case-sensitive. For example, `video_ts`, `Video_Ts`, or `Bdmv`
          are not treated as discs but as regular directories.

          For disc folders, the converted video file’s name matches the folder name.
          For example, `/watch/MyMovie/VIDEO_TS` produces `MyMovie.mp4`.

          Video discs may have multiple titles (e.g., main movie, previews, extras).
          Each title is converted to a separate file with a `.title-XX` suffix, where `XX`
          is the title number. For example, if `MyMovie.iso` has two titles, the output
          files are:
            - `MyMovie.title-1.mp4`
            - `MyMovie.title-2.mp4`

          Titles shorter than a specified duration can be ignored. By default, only titles
          longer than 10 seconds are processed, adjustable via the
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_SOURCE_MIN_DURATION` environment variable.
      - title: Hooks
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Custom actions can be performed using hooks, which are shell scripts executed by
          the automatic video converter.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Hooks are always executed via `/bin/sh`, ignoring any shebang in the script.

          Hooks are optional and undefined by default. A hook is executed when a script is
          found at a specific location.

          The following table describes available hooks:

          | Container Location | Description | Parameter(s) |
          |--------------------|-------------|--------------|
          | `/config/hooks/pre_conversion.sh` | Executed before a video conversion begins. | The first argument is the path of the converted video. The second argument is the path to the source file. The third argument is the name of the Handbrake preset used for conversion. |
          | `/config/hooks/post_conversion.sh` | Executed when a video conversion completes. | The first parameter is the conversion status (`0` for success, any other value for failure). The second argument is the path to the converted video. The third argument is the path to the source file. The fourth argument is the name of the Handbrake preset used for conversion. |
          | `/config/hooks/post_watch_folder_processing.sh` | Executed after all videos in the watch folder are processed. | The path of the watch folder. |
          | `/config/hooks/hb_custom_args.sh` | Executed to obtain custom {{ app.friendly_name }} arguments for conversion. The script should print a space-separated list of arguments to its standard output. | The first argument is the path to the source file. The second argument is the name of the Handbrake preset used for conversion. |

          > [!TIP]
          > Example hooks are installed in `/config/hooks/` with a `.example` suffix. They
          > can be used as a starting point.

          > [!TIP]
          > Use the `INSTALL_PACKAGES` environment variable to install additional
          > packages needed by features implemented via hooks.
      - title: Temporary Conversion Directory
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Videos being converted are written to a hidden, temporary directory under the
          root of the output directory (`/output` by default). Once conversion completes
          successfully, the video file is moved to its final location.

          This feature is useful when the output folder is monitored by another
          application, ensuring it only sees the final converted file, not transient
          versions.

          If the monitoring application ignores hidden directories, no special
          configuration is needed.

          If the monitoring application processes hidden directories, set the
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR` environment variable to a subdirectory and
          configure the monitoring application to watch this subdirectory. For example,
          if `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR` is set to `TV Shows` and `/output` is
          mapped to `/home/user/appvolumes/HandBrake` on the host, monitor
          `/home/user/appvolumes/HandBrake/TV Shows`.
      - title: Intel Quick Sync Video
        level: 2
        content: |-
          Intel Quick Sync Video is Intel’s dedicated video encoding and decoding hardware
          core, offloading tasks to the integrated GPU to reduce CPU usage and improve
          power efficiency.

          For {{ app.friendly_name }} to use hardware-accelerated encoding, the following
          are required:
            - A compatible Intel processor. Check if your CPU supports Quick Sync Video on
              the [Intel Ark] website. The processor model is logged during container
              startup, e.g.:
              ```
              [cont-init.d] 54-check-qsv.sh: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz
              ```
            - The Intel i915 graphics driver must be loaded on the host.
            - The `/dev/dri` device must be exposed to the container using the
              `--device /dev/dri` parameter in the `docker run` command.

          When Intel Quick Sync Video is enabled, {{ app.friendly_name }} offers the
          `H.264 (Intel QSV)` video encoder. If this encoder is not listed, check the
          container’s log for details on the issue.

          > [!NOTE]
          > In most cases, {{ app.friendly_name }} can access `/dev/dri` without host
          > modifications, as the container’s user is automatically added to the group
          > owning the device. If the device is owned by the `root` group, use one of
          > these solutions:
          >   - Change the group owning the `/dev/dri` device on the host. For example,
          >     to set it to `video`:
          >     ```
          >     sudo chown root:video /dev/dri/*
          >     ```
          >   - Grant read/write permissions to all for the `/dev/dri` device on the host:
          >     ```
          >     sudo chmod a+wr /dev/dri/*
          >     ```
          >   - Run the container as root (`USER_ID=0`). Not recommended for security
          >     reason.

      - title: unRAID
        level: 3
        content: |-
          In recent unRAID versions, the Intel i915 driver is included and loaded
          automatically.

          For older versions, add the following lines to `/boot/config/go` to load the
          driver during unRAID startup:

          ```
          # Load the i915 driver.
          modprobe i915
          ```
      - title: Nightly Builds
        level: 2
        content: |-
          Nightly builds are based on the latest {{ app.friendly_name }} development code
          and may contain bugs, crashes, or instabilities.

          Nightly builds are available via Docker image tags in the format:

          ```
          nightly-<COMMIT_DATE>-<COMMIT_HASH>
          ```

          Where:
            - `COMMIT_DATE` is the date (in `YYMMDDHHMMSS` format) of the latest commit
              from the {{ app.friendly_name }} [Git repository].
            - `COMMIT_HASH` is the short hash of the latest commit.

          The latest nightly build is available via the `nightly-latest` tag. View all
          tags on [Docker Hub].

          To use a nightly build, append the tag to the Docker image name during container
          creation, e.g.:

          ```
          docker run [OPTIONS...] jlesage/{{ app.name }}:nightly-latest
          ```

      - title: Debug Builds
        level: 2
        content: |-
          Debug builds are used to investigate issues with {{ app.friendly_name }}. They
          are compiled in debug mode with all symbols retained, primarily for debugging
          crashes.

          To generate a core dump when {{ app.friendly_name }} crashes, two requirements
          must be met:
            1. Enable core dumps by setting the maximum core size using the
               `--ulimit core=-1` parameter in the `docker run` command (`-1` means
               unlimited).
            2. Set the core dump location on the host with:

               ```
               echo 'CORE_PATTERN' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
               ```

               Replace `CORE_PATTERN` with a template for naming core dump files. For
               example, to store core dumps in the container’s configuration volume (for
               easy host access), use `/config/core.%e.%t`.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Core dump files contain the application’s complete memory layout and are
          > created with restrictive permissions. To allow access by a user other than the
          > one running {{ app.friendly_name }}, run `chmod a+r CORE`, where `CORE` is the
          > path to the core file.

          > [!NOTE]
          > The core dump pattern is shared between the host and container. Revert to the
          > original pattern after debugging by checking the current pattern with
          > `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`.

          Debug builds are available via Docker image tags with a `debug` suffix. Check
          available tags on [Docker Hub].

          To use a debug build, append the tag to the Docker image name, e.g.:

          ```
          docker run [OPTIONS...] jlesage/{{ app.name }}:v1.14.3-debug
          ```

          [Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlesage/{{ app.name }}/tags/
      - title: unRAID
